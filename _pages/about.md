InfoLab has blazed a trail of groundbreaking research across various frontiers. With spatial crowdsourcing-coined right here in InfoLab -- we've ventured into uncharted territories, redefining how we harness collective intelligence. Our pioneering work in road-network queries and navigation has reshaped how we navigate the world around us, while our innovations in location privacy have safeguarded individual rights in an increasingly interconnected era. Through spatiotemporal indexing and queries, we've unlocked new dimensions in data exploration, and our strides in geospatial information integration have bridged gaps between data realms.

Our illustrious journey through the landscape of spatial data has solidified our reputation as trailblazers in the field. Our unyielding commitment to excellence has empowered us to reshape the very fabric of spatial computing. Our track record stands as a testament to our enduring dedication, as we continue to illuminate the path forward for the next generation of technological advancements. 

Moreover, our influence doesn't stop within these walls. Our alumni, now shaping the tech landscape at Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta, serve as living testaments to the impact of our work. They're the driving force behind the future of spatial and location data applications, infusing their expertise with the InfoLab spirit to pioneer innovation that reaches far beyond our laboratory. 

*Join us* in exploring the intricacies of spatial data that have been our hallmark for more than 25 years, and together, let's shape the future of this ever-evolving field—with a hint of that playful InfoLab spirit.
