### Research Agenda

Just 25 years ago, "searching for data" meant using a set of controlled queries to an IBM database to look for homogenously structured alphanumeric data stored on a centralized storage system. Everything has changed in the field of information management today. The data isn't just alphanumeric, but includes images, maps, video, audio and signals; the queries are complex data-mining questions; the architecture is distributed and includes not just the Web, but sensor networks, peer-to-peer nodes and portable devices; and the users do not have a PhD in computer science! The mission of InfoLab is to investigate new approaches to the management of unconventional data types within atypical architectures.
