Accurately forecasting the number of visits to Points-of-Interest (POIs) in an urban area is crucial for various application domains, including urban planning, public health, and social studies. However, current approaches do not fully exploit the complex multi-context correlations among POIs. In this study, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. BysGNN utilizes all contextual information, including POI semantics and time-series data, to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. It then passes the learned graph to a GNN block to perform forecasting. We ran experiments on real-world data and observed a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy compared to other baselines.
