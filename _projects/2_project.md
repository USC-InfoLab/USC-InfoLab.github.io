This project develops a framework for hyperlocal risk monitoring and data-driven decision-making. Such hyperlocal awareness can help governments and response officials at all levels with policy-making, e.g., opening in-person or online; closing or partially shutting down businesses; proactively reallocating medical supplies and medical workforces to more vulnerable areas, enabling better preparation and readiness for disease outbreaks. It can also benefit community membersâ€™ decision-making, e.g., avoiding high-risk areas. We use fine-grained mobility and social interactions data to better model infection spread. Furthermore, we use privacy-enhanced monitoring techniques to protect users' privacy.
