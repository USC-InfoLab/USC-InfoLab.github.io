The widespread use of location-tracking technologies such as GPS and GSM networks has made it easy for individuals to create a spatial-temporal record of their whereabouts. This has created an opportunity to extract valuable insights from this type of data. This project aims to understand and capture individualâ€™s general life styles and regularity. Mining individual life patterns has the potential to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. One important application of life pattern analysis is in location-based recommendation systems. By understanding an individual's life pattern, recommendation engines can provide more personalized recommendations for products and services that are relevant to their lifestyle.  We use large-scale GPS location data and spatial temporal point processes to uncover the hidden spatiotemporal patterns from the locations.
